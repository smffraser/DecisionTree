# DecisionTree

An application used to create a Decision Tree given a set of training data. This specific algorithm creates a decision tree using information gain and a "less than or equal to" threshold. Created for CS486 (AI) Assignment 5 (Winter 2017, Kate Larson, University of Waterloo).

The two files are specific to the training data provided for the assignment. The algorithm can easily be changed to work with any set of complete training data.

* decision2.rb matches with the horse colic data. 
* decision3.rb matches with the class pass/fail data.

**To Run:**

    ruby decision.rb
